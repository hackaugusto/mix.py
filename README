mix.py
------

mix.py is a coroutine library. Coroutines might also be called Fibers
(Windows), Green Threads (Java), or Lightweight Threads.

vs. Greenlet
--------

The main difference between mix.py and greenlet is the stack handling, while
greenlet relies heavily on the use of copying to exchange stacks mix.py uses a
fixed size stack.

That said, greenlet has the advantage that it's stacks can grow, while mix.py
cannot (at least not without spagetthi stacks, and that is not tested for the
moment), and mix.py sacrifices that benefit for the improved performance of
_not_ copying stacks to and from the heap.

compiling
---------

mix.py is coded in C++ with boost, it requires a least a C++11 compatible
compiler and boost 1.60.0, and obviously Python's headers are required.

Use the package setup.py to compile the package with `python setup.py bdist`
